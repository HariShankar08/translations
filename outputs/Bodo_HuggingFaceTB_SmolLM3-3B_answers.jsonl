On 10/9, due to oliguria in the last 24 hours, however, maintaining a positive fluid balance, he was transferred to the semi-intensive care unit without the use of vasoactive drugs due to the hypothesis of nephrotoxicity. On 10/10, vasoactive drugs were restarted due to poor peripheral perfusion. Neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium was suspended. [person] developed abdominal distension, with suspension of the diet. On 10/14, an abdominal ultrasound was performed with no signs of ascites or gaseous distension. On 10/15, sedation was suspended. On the same day, [person] presented with a deviation of the fixed gaze to the right, being evaluated by neurology and, after a computed tomography scan of the skull and electroencephalogram, without new alterations that would justify the condition, vitamin B1 replacement was indicated. On 10/19, a thoracic ultrasound was performed, showing evidence of pleural effusion on the left, measuring approximately 3.3 cm. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, with negative transudate culture and bacilloscopy, but with positive TBTRM on 10/22. At the time, a case of ICC was discussed, and as [person] did not present a picture suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis upon admission, with no characteristic image, remaining afebrile throughout hospitalization, with progressive improvement of the pulmonary condition with Bactrim, in addition to 3 negative gastric lavage bacilloscopy samples in August of that year, it was decided not to isolate [person] and not to collect bacilloscopy again, since the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was very unlikely. On 10/22, extubation was performed, without complications. On 10/23, [person] presented diarrhea, with liquid stools, no pathological products and no other systemic symptoms. On 10/25, he started a soft oral diet with good acceptance, and the nasogastric tube was removed and treatment for pleural tuberculosis was initiated by the attending medical team. On 10/26, [person] was admitted to a bed in the [organization] ward and, on 10/29, transferred to a bed in the [organization] ward, under the care of the infectious disease team. On 10/28, treatment for pneumocystosis with Bactrim D21/D21 was suspended and corticosteroid therapy was suspended, with Bactrim being resumed at a prophylactic dose for neurotoxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis. During hospitalization, [person] presented persistent thrombocytopenia while on prophylactic anticoagulation. Hematology assessed him and indicated the start of full-dose subcutaneous fondaparinoux 7.5 mg. On 11/3, with a platelet count above 150,000, dual anticoagulation with warfarin 5 mg/day was initiated. maintained until 11/08, with warfarin adjustment according to prothrombin time, due to anticoagulation for 4 weeks. In addition, [person] presented anemia probably secondary to azathioprine myelotoxicity and vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 replacement was started, 1 vial of 5000 mcg 1x per week. Upon admission to the [organization] ward, it was decided to suspend the RIP regimen due to an acute clinical laboratory picture not compatible with pulmonary or pleural tuberculosis. [person] presented infectious urinalysis culture positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, but as he remained asymptomatic and with good renal function, it was decided not to treat it, considering contamination.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced.

Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with moderate diffuse encephalopathy, of a nonspecific nature in relation to the previous tracing; significant improvement is noted, with mitigation of grda and suppression of stimulus-induced generalized epileptogenesis. electroencephalogram 02/01: slight symmetrical disorganization of the baseline activity due to the slowing of the dominant posterior rhythm of wakefulness, recorded at a frequency of up to 6.5 Hz, however with the presence of typical physiological graphoelements of sleep. b recording of epileptiform paroxysms of the spike and sharp wave type, with generalized projection, with anterior accentuation, occurring in rhythmic bursts of short duration of 3 to 4 seconds. the paroxysms are followed by delta waves and, occasionally, rhythmic activity in the beta range of short duration of less than 1 second, which also occurred preceding the bursts of paroxysms, as well as in an isolated episode during drowsiness. c outbreaks of generalized delta activity, with bifrontal accentuation, the same projections as the paroxysms, also occurring exclusively during sleep. note: [person] presented stereotyped cephalic lateralization and oromandibular movements during wakefulness, however, without electrographic correlation with ictal patterns. conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. the findings are compatible with diffuse encephalopathy and generalized epilepsy. computed tomography of the skull 11/12: no relevant alterations; computed tomography of the chest 11/12: no signs of an infectious process; cerebrospinal fluid 13/12: 1 cell; 0 red blood cells; glucose: 96; protein: non-reactive; chloride: 125; lactate: 1.91; transthoracic echocardiography 23/12: no signs of vegetation. no other alterations. cultures: tracheal aspirate: 12/27: enterobacter cloacae complex sensitive to meropenem 12/19: negative 12/12: staphylococcus aureus oxas resistant to clindamycin 01/07: staphylococcus epidermididis oxar blood culture: 12/27: negative so far 12/19: staphylococcus hominis 12/13: negative 01/07: 01/16: pseudomonas aeroginosas sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside urine culture: 12/27: negative 01/07: negative venous catheter: 12/27: negative 12/19: corynebacterium sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin 01/09: staphylococcus epidermidis oxar cerebrospinal fluid: 12/13: micrococcus sp antibiotic therapy: current: ceftazidime d0 01/19 pseudomonas bloodstream infection.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced. Electroencephalogram 12/22: a moderate symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to an increase in the content of slow waves in the theta and delta bands, in addition to a lack and poor definition of the physiological graphoelements of sleep.

The findings are compatible with moderate diffuse encephalopathy, of a nonspecific nature in relation to the previous tracing; significant improvement is noted, with mitigation of grda and suppression of stimulus-induced generalized epileptogenesis. electroencephalogram 02/01: slight symmetrical disorganization of the baseline activity due to the slowing of the dominant posterior rhythm of wakefulness, recorded at a frequency of up to 6.5 Hz, however with the presence of typical physiological graphoelements of sleep. b recording of epileptiform paroxysms of the spike and sharp wave type, with generalized projection, with anterior accentuation, occurring in rhythmic bursts of short duration of 3 to 4 seconds. the paroxysms are followed by delta waves and, occasionally, rhythmic activity in the beta range of short duration of less than 1 second, which also occurred preceding the bursts of paroxysms, as well as in an isolated episode during drowsiness. c outbreaks of generalized delta activity, with bifrontal accentuation, the same projections as the paroxysms, also occurring exclusively during sleep. note: [person] presented stereotyped cephalic lateralization and oromandibular movements during wakefulness, however, without electrographic correlation with ictal patterns. conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. the findings are compatible with diffuse encephalopathy and generalized epilepsy. computed tomography of the skull 11/12: no relevant alterations; computed tomography of the chest 11/12: no signs of an infectious process; cerebrospinal fluid 13/12: 1 cell; 0 red blood cells; glucose: 96; protein: non-reactive; chloride: 125; lactate: 1.91; transthoracic echocardiography 23/12: no signs of vegetation. no other alterations. cultures: tracheal aspirate: 12/27: enterobacter cloacae complex sensitive to meropenem 12/19: negative 12/12: staphylococcus aureus oxas resistant to clindamycin 01/07: staphylococcus epidermididis oxar blood culture: 12/27: negative so far 12/19: staphylococcus hominis 12/13: negative 01/07: 01/16: pseudomonas aeroginosas sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside urine culture: 12/27: negative 01/07: negative venous catheter: 12/27: negative 12/19: corynebacterium sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin 01/09: staphylococcus epidermidis oxar cerebrospinal fluid: 12/13: micrococcus sp antibiotic therapy: current: ceftazidime d0 01/19 pseudomonas bloodstream infection.

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward and, from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology.

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology.

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21.
