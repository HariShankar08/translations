On 10/9, due to oliguria in the last 24 hours, however, maintaining a positive fluid balance, he was transferred to the semi-intensive care unit without the use of vasoactive drugs due to the hypothesis of nephrotoxicity. On 10/10, vasoactive drugs were restarted due to poor peripheral perfusion. Neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium was suspended. [person] developed abdominal distension, with suspension of the diet. On 10/14, an abdominal ultrasound was performed with no signs of ascites or gaseous distension. On 10/15, sedation was suspended. On the same day, [person] presented with a deviation of the fixed gaze to the right, being evaluated by neurology and, after a computed tomography scan of the skull and electroencephalogram, without new alterations that would justify the condition, vitamin B1 replacement was indicated.

On 10/9, due to oliguria in the last 24 hours, however, maintaining a positive fluid balance, he was transferred to the semi-intensive care unit without the use of vasoactive drugs due to the hypothesis of nephrotoxicity. On 10/10, vasoactive drugs were restarted due to poor peripheral perfusion. Neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium was suspended. [person] developed abdominal distension, with suspension of the diet. On 10/14, an abdominal ultrasound was performed with no signs of ascites or gaseous distension. On 10/15, sedation was suspended. On the same day, [person] presented with a deviation of the fixed gaze to the right, being evaluated by neurology and, after a computed tomography scan of the skull and electroencephalogram, without new alterations that would justify the condition, vitamin B1 replacement was indicated. On 10/19, a thoracic ultrasound was performed, showing evidence of pleural effusion on the left, measuring approximately 3.3 cm. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, with negative transudate culture and bacilloscopy, but with positive TBTRM on 10/22. At the time, a case of ICC was discussed, and as [person] did not present a picture suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis upon admission, with no characteristic image, remaining afebrile throughout hospitalization, with progressive improvement of the pulmonary condition with Bactrim, in addition to 3 negative gastric lavage bacilloscopy samples in August of that year, it was decided not to isolate [person] and not to collect bacilloscopy again, since the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was very unlikely. On 10/22, extubation was performed, without complications. On 10/23, [person] presented diarrhea, with liquid stools, no pathological products and no other systemic symptoms. On 10/25, he started a soft oral diet with good acceptance, and the nasogastric tube was removed and treatment for pleural tuberculosis was initiated by the attending medical team. On 10/26, [person] was admitted to a bed in the [organization] ward and, on 10/29, transferred to a bed in the [organization] ward, under the care of the infectious disease team. On 10/28, treatment for pneumocystosis with Bactrim D21/D21 was suspended and corticosteroid therapy was suspended, with Bactrim being resumed at a prophylactic dose for neurotoxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis. During hospitalization, [person] presented persistent thrombocytopenia while on prophylactic anticoagulation. Hematology assessed him and indicated the start of full-dose subcutaneous fondaparinoux 7.5 mg. On 11/3, with a platelet count above 150,000, dual anticoagulation with warfarin 5 mg/day was initiated. maintained until 11/08, with warfarin adjustment according to prothrombin time, due to anticoagulation for 4 weeks. In addition, [person] presented anemia probably secondary to azathioprine myelotoxicity and vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 replacement was started, 1 vial of 5000 mcg 1x per week. Upon admission to the [organization] ward, it was decided to suspend the RIP regimen due to an acute clinical laboratory picture not compatible with pulmonary or pleural tuberculosis. [person] presented infectious urinalysis culture positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, but as he remained asymptomatic and with good renal function, it was decided not to treat it, considering contamination. [person] is currently fit for hospital discharge, being on room air, with no signs of discomfort, hemodynamically stable, not using vasoactive drugs, and with good acceptance of oral diet, assisted only by the risk of bronchoaspiration, with international normalized ratio in the range of 2.9 with 5 mg of warfarin/day.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced.

There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena.

Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep.

{"discharge_summary": "admission: 12/11/2020, discharge: 01/23/2021, stay: 01 m 11 d 10 h, location: ward, payer: sus [person], 28 years old, from [address] 12/14 weight: 102 kg height: 162 cm. problem: 1 Status epilepticus secondary to pulmonary infection Phenytoin attack performed and maintenance dose of PHT increased Pb dosage maintained Dosage of other drugs LTG, TPM and CLB 2 Sepsis pulmonary focus 3 Deep vein thrombosis Right lower limb Full dose of enoxaparin started on 12/23 4 Pseudomembranous colitis Metronidazole started 12/30 01/10 5 Adrenal insufficiency secondary to sepsis Hydrocortisone 50 mg every 12h started on 12/31 Weaning started on 01/10 Previous functionality Oral diet Walked without assistance Dependent for some instrumental activities of daily living Bathing, physiological eliminations. Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced. Electroencephalogram 12/22: a moderate symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to an increase in the content of slow waves in the theta and delta bands, in addition to a lack and poor definition of the physiological graphoelements of sleep.

I leave pending tests to monitor eosinophilia and GGT changes, atrial fibrillation that, together with the rash presented after vancomycin on 10/31, raised the diagnostic hypothesis of DRESS syndrome by the dermatologist. Despite this hypothesis, [person] showed complete improvement of the rash and a decrease in the eosinophil count. Therefore, we opted for discharge due to low clinical suspicion at the time. I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward and, from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time.

Despite this hypothesis, [person] showed complete improvement of the rash and a decrease in the eosinophil count. Therefore, we opted for discharge due to low clinical suspicion at the time. I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology.

She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology. On 10/31, the patient presented a skin rash with no hemodynamic repercussions and no warning signs. The hypothesis of Dress syndrome was raised, but [person] showed improvement on 11/4 with improvement in eosinophilia. discharged on 11/04/21, hemodynamically stable, eupneic, afebrile since 10/15, after finishing intravenous vancomycin with a schedule to follow-up appointment daily for infusion of micafungin 100 mg/day at the hospital on the scheduled end date of 11/21, as well as a scheduled follow-up appointment at [organization] for 11/08 to re-discuss the therapeutic schedule and arrange for the next lines of daratunumab chemotherapy.", "question": "\u0939\u092e \u0921\u0947\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0938\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u091a\u0947\u0915 \u0907\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0948\u0924 \u0915\u093e\u0932, \u092f\u093e\u0928\u093f \u096b \u0905\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0942\u092c\u0930 \u0915\u0947\u0964", "answer": "Yes\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0947?\n\nAnswer: \u0939\u093e\u0901\n\nQuestion: \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a"}

I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology.
