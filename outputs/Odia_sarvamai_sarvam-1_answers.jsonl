Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced.

Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with moderate diffuse encephalopathy, of a nonspecific nature in relation to the previous tracing; significant improvement is noted, with mitigation of grda and suppression of stimulus-induced generalized epileptogenesis. electroencephalogram 02/01: slight symmetrical disorganization of the baseline activity due to the slowing of the dominant posterior rhythm of wakefulness, recorded at a frequency of up to 6.5 Hz, however with the presence of typical physiological graphoelements of sleep. b recording of epileptiform paroxysms of the spike and sharp wave type, with generalized projection, with anterior accentuation, occurring in rhythmic bursts of short duration of 3 to 4 seconds. the paroxysms are followed by delta waves and, occasionally, rhythmic activity in the beta range of short duration of less than 1 second, which also occurred preceding the bursts of paroxysms, as well as in an isolated episode during drowsiness. c outbreaks of generalized delta activity, with bifrontal accentuation, the same projections as the paroxysms, also occurring exclusively during sleep. note: [person] presented stereotyped cephalic lateralization and oromandibular movements during wakefulness, however, without electrographic correlation with ictal patterns. conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. the findings are compatible with diffuse encephalopathy and generalized epilepsy. computed tomography of the skull 11/12: no relevant alterations; computed tomography of the chest 11/12: no signs of an infectious process; cerebrospinal fluid 13/12: 1 cell; 0 red blood cells; glucose: 96; protein: non-reactive; chloride: 125; lactate: 1.91; transthoracic echocardiography 23/12: no signs of vegetation. no other alterations. cultures: tracheal aspirate: 12/27: enterobacter cloacae complex sensitive to meropenem 12/19: negative 12/12: staphylococcus aureus oxas resistant to clindamycin 01/07: staphylococcus epidermididis oxar blood culture: 12/27: negative so far 12/19: staphylococcus hominis 12/13: negative 01/07: 01/16: pseudomonas aeroginosas sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside urine culture: 12/27: negative 01/07: negative venous catheter: 12/27: negative 12/19: corynebacterium sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin 01/09: staphylococcus epidermidis oxar cerebrospinal fluid: 12/13: micrococcus sp antibiotic therapy: current: ceftazidime d0 01/19 pseudomonas bloodstream infection.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced. Electroencephalogram 12/22: a moderate symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to an increase in the content of slow waves in the theta and delta bands, in addition to a lack and poor definition of the physiological graphoelements of sleep.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced. Electroencephalogram 12/22: a moderate symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to an increase in the content of slow waves in the theta and delta bands, in addition to a lack and poor definition of the physiological graphoelements of sleep.

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime.

Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21.

I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21.

A 67-year-old patient with a history of overweight, smoking, and major depression was admitted on 09/01 with a perforative acute abdomen, diagnosed after examinations. On the evening of 08/31, she sought care with abdominal pain, general malaise, and dyspnea. She had undergone hysterectomy on 08/30. On 09/01, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with a finding of intestinal perforation, with a suture of the lesion and placement of a peritoneostomy. She developed severe circulatory shock, probably due to peritonitis from contamination of the abdominal cavity, and antibiotic treatment was promptly started. She was re-addressed on 09/06, where an appendectomy and abdominal wall closure were performed. On 09/07, the patient's ventilatory status began to worsen, and a chest tomography scan was performed on 09/08, revealing low-load pulmonary embolism (5%) in addition to pneumonia. A multiresistant germ was isolated in a lung culture, with specific treatment directed at the patient. Given the clinical progression, a tracheostomy was indicated due to the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. On 09/15, {omitted} prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest was reversed after approximately 20 minutes.
