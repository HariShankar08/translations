Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep.

Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp.

{"discharge_summary": "admission: 12/11/2020, discharge: 01/23/2021, stay: 01 m 11 d 10 h, location: ward, payer: sus [person], 28 years old, from [address] 12/14 weight: 102 kg height: 162 cm. problem: 1 Status epilepticus secondary to pulmonary infection Phenytoin attack performed and maintenance dose of PHT increased Pb dosage maintained Dosage of other drugs LTG, TPM and CLB 2 Sepsis pulmonary focus 3 Deep vein thrombosis Right lower limb Full dose of enoxaparin started on 12/23 4 Pseudomembranous colitis Metronidazole started 12/30 01/10 5 Adrenal insufficiency secondary to sepsis Hydrocortisone 50 mg every 12h started on 12/31 Weaning started on 01/10 Previous functionality Oral diet Walked without assistance Dependent for some instrumental activities of daily living Bathing, physiological eliminations. Tests: Electroencephalogram 12/12: Mild to moderate disorganization of baseline activity due to increased slow wave content in the theta and delta bands, but with the presence of normal sleep graphoelements. There was no clinical or electrographic reactivity to nociceptive stimulation. b Record of electrographic seizures of variable duration (4 to 9 seconds), characterized by rhythmic activity in the beta range, evolving to alpha and theta ranges, associated with spike-type epileptiform paroxysms, with generalized projection, without associated clinical phenomena. There was a record of a seizure with rhythmic evolution to the delta range and of longer duration (18 seconds). Rare spike-type paroxysms were recorded, occurring isolatedly in the left frontocentral region. Clinical correlation: The findings are consistent with focal epilepsy with electrographic seizures, but do not characterize status epilepticus. electroencephalogram 12/19: marked symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to persistent rhythmic, semi-rhythmic bifrontal slowing in the delta band, at approximately 1.5 Hz, of medium amplitude, only temporarily mitigated by nociceptive stimulation; furthermore, lack and poor definition of physiological graphoelements of sleep. Upon nociceptive stimulation, there is also a triggering of generalized rhythmic epileptiform activity in the beta band, of low voltage, which evolves into an outbreak of frank epileptiform paroxysms of the spike type followed by a slow wave, also of diffuse expression, and with bifrontal accentuation of such stimulus-induced discharges, suppression of the clinical tracing follows; [person] presents only with painful facies. b Occasionally, associated with the slow waves described above, bisynchronous epileptiform paroxysms of the sharp wave type are observed, involving the anterior regions of the scalp. Conclusion and electroclinical correlation: the electroencephalogram was abnormal. The findings are compatible with severe diffuse encephalopathy of a nonspecific nature, associated with focal and generalized interictal epileptogenesis, the latter being stimulus-induced. Electroencephalogram 12/22: a moderate symmetrical disorganization of the background activity due to an increase in the content of slow waves in the theta and delta bands, in addition to a lack and poor definition of the physiological graphoelements of sleep.

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium.

Despite this hypothesis, [person] showed complete improvement of the rash and a decrease in the eosinophil count. Therefore, we opted for discharge due to low clinical suspicion at the time. I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology. On 10/31, the patient presented a skin rash with no hemodynamic repercussions and no warning signs. The hypothesis of Dress syndrome was raised, but [person] showed improvement on 11/4 with improvement in eosinophilia. discharged on 11/04/21, hemodynamically stable, eupneic, afebrile since 10/15, after finishing intravenous vancomycin with a schedule to follow-up appointment daily for infusion of micafungin 100 mg/day at the hospital on the scheduled end date of 11/21, as well as a scheduled follow-up appointment at [organization] for 11/08 to re-discuss the therapeutic schedule and arrange for the next lines of daratunumab chemotherapy.", "question": "ഒക്ടോബർ 19-ന് നടത്തിയ കരൾ പരിശോധനയുടെ (എക്കോകാർഡിയോഗ്രാം) ഫലം എന്തായിരുന്നു?", "answer": "ഒക്ടോബർ 19ന്, ട്രാൻസ് ഇസോഫേജിയൽ എക്കോകാർഡിയോഗ്രാഫിയിൽ മിത്രൽ വാൽവ് പ്രോലാപ്സ് വർദ്ധിക്കുന്നതായി നിരീക്ഷിക്കപ്പെട്ടു, ഇത് അണുബാധയെ സൂചിപ്പിക്കുന്നു (ഫിലമെൻ്റ് ഇമേജിംഗ്), ഇത് ബാക്ടീരിയയും ഫംഗസും മൂലമുണ്ടാകുന്ന എൻഡോകാർഡൈറ്റിസ് എന്ന രോഗനിർണയത്തിനുള്ള സാധ്യത വർദ്ധിപ്പിക്കുന്നു."}

While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury.

I leave pending tests to monitor eosinophilia and GGT changes, atrial fibrillation that, together with the rash presented after vancomycin on 10/31, raised the diagnostic hypothesis of DRESS syndrome by the dermatologist. Despite this hypothesis, [person] showed complete improvement of the rash and a decrease in the eosinophil count. Therefore, we opted for discharge due to low clinical suspicion at the time. I performed reassessment tests for the disease on the day of hospital discharge. hospitalization summary: [person] admitted on 10/04 on d11 of i mcbad d5 of [person] from [organization]. attended a consultation for clinical and laboratory evaluation after hospitalization 09/21 - 10/01. While waiting to be called for a consultation, she developed tremors and an increase in body temperature (pre-consultation temperature 35.6 during tremors 37.3). Due to neutropneic, she was admitted for treatment of febrile neutropenia with immediate initiation of cefepime. She was hospitalized from 09/21 to 10/01 due to dyspnea, when an extensive right lung lesion was identified, with extrinsic compression of the superior vena cava and right atrium. On September 24, the MCBAD regimen was initiated, but during the night of that date, he developed acute pulmonary edema (fluid overload), which resolved after noninvasive ventilation and furosemide. He remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days. He was discharged to the ward, and from there, to [address]. He underwent a control tomography on September 29, which showed complete resolution of compression and reduction of lung injury. After one day of hospitalization, on 10/05, she presented septic shock with need for vasoactive drugs and decreased level of consciousness, being referred to [organization], where she was hospitalized until 10/12. On 10/10, cultures with growth of yeast-like fungi were seen in blood culture 1 sample after 7:00 p.m. Candida tropicalis. Contacted [organization] and started on micafungin 100 mg 1x/day, as well as fungemia protocol, removal of central access and PIA devices, implantation of peripherally inserted central catheter and collection of catheter tip. In addition to abdominal and fundus ultrasound. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetations on examination. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 10/19 with the presence of filamentous images in the mitral valve suggestive of infectious vegetation, associated with mild mitral insufficiency, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis. Discussed with [person] from [organization] on 10/18, who advised to maintain micafungin because most Candida tropicalis are sensitive. Chest tomography was repeated on 10/18, showing control of multiple myeloma with extensive bone and right pleural disease, with disease stability in relation to 09/29 and pulmonary opacities including nodules, with the main suspicion of infectious alteration being septic embolism or fungal disease. In discussion with the [organization] team and rediscussed with [organization], we were advised to maintain antibiotics for 4 weeks from the start of treatment and not from the culture on 10/05/21 and antifungal for 6 weeks from 10/10/21. After the 6 weeks, repeat the echocardiogram and continue oral voriconazole for an indefinite period of time. Candida tropicalis is resistant to fluco and intermediate to voriconazole, given that there is no surgical plan for removal of vegetation of possible fungal etiology.
